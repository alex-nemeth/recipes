    <h3>Recipe step-by-step</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Add a bit of butter to a pan, put it on high heat</li>
        <li>Crack your eggs into a bowl on the side</li>
        <li>Once your butter is bubbling, add your eggs into the pan</li>
        <li>Add in some salt and bring the heat to a very low level</li>
        <li>Slowly cook with constant scrambling (if your eggs are sticking to the pan, the heat is too high!)</li>
        <li>Once your eggs start to look good, add in a teaspoon of mayonnaise for extra creaminess</li>
        <li>Now it's usually a good idea to turn off the stove</li>
        <li>With the stove being off, keep scrambling on the residue heat until the mayonnaise blends in</li>
        <li>Once your eggs look creamy (but not runny), you can take the pan off the stove</li>
        <li>Get some bread slices, and divide your creamy eggs on top of them</li>
        <li>Sprinkle a bit of black pepper and/or some chilli powder for a better taste</li>
        <li>Add in your tomatoes as a side</li>
        <li>Serve!</li>
    </ol>
    <p>This recipe might be harder to get right the first time, but everytime you go for it you will develop a better feel for it</p>
    <p>The key for a tasty structure and creaminess is patience. They need to be cooked very slowly on minimal heat.</p>
    <p>Good luck and enjoy!</p>
